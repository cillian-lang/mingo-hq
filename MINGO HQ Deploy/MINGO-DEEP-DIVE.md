## 1. WHAT IS MINGO?

**MINGO** is a digital infrastructure company that started as a **wallet and messaging app** (~2016), built on the **Hedera** network from **2018**, and later pivoted its primary focus to **NFT-based ticketing** and fan engagement. The wallet remains part of the broader ecosystem.

### Origin Story
MINGO began as a mobile wallet and messaging platform. After building on Hedera as one of its earliest adopters in 2018, the team recognized a massive opportunity in the broken ticketing industry. They pivoted their core focus to blockchain-based ticketing — leveraging Hedera's speed, low fees, and enterprise governance to solve real problems: fraud, scalping, and excessive fees. The wallet still exists as part of the ecosystem, powering token and NFT management.

### Core Products
- **MINGO Tickets** — Progressive web app (no app download needed) for secure, verifiable digital ticketing (primary product)
- **MINGO Wallet** — Digital wallet on Hedera for managing tickets, tokens, and NFT collectibles (original product, now supporting the ticketing ecosystem)
- **AstroKarts** — Play-to-earn game within the MINGO ecosystem
- **MingoLaunch** — Launchpad supporting NFT and game developers building on Hedera (integration help, tokenomics guidance, seed funding, IGO hosting)

## 3. THE PROBLEM MINGO SOLVES

The legacy ticketing industry is broken:
- **Fraud & Counterfeits** — Fake tickets are rampant, no way to verify authenticity
- **Scalping** — Bots buy tickets instantly, resell at 3-10x markup
- **High Fees** — Legacy platforms charge **15-27%** in fees
- **No Transparency** — Centralized systems offer no visibility into ticket distribution
- **Poor Fan Experience** — Tickets are just access passes, no additional value
- **Lost Revenue** — Organizers get nothing from secondary market sales

### MINGO's Solution
- **3.5% fees** (vs 15-20% legacy) — massive cost saving for organizers
- **On-chain verification** — Every ticket is an NFT, tamper-proof, verifiable
- **Anti-scalping** — Organizers can set price caps on resales
- **Secondary market revenue** — Organizers earn commissions from resales
- **Programmable tickets** — Tickets can carry:
  - Personalized messages from artists
  - Unique live content snippets from the event
  - Future event discounts
  - Exclusive music releases
  - Sponsor engagement/offers
  - VIP upgrades, meet-and-greets
  - Digital collectible keepsakes
- **No crypto knowledge needed** — Email login, self-custodial wallet, web2 simplicity with web3 benefits
- **Progressive web app** — Works on any device, no download required

## 8. SOCIAL MEDIA AUDIT (as of Feb 11, 2026)

### @mingoapps on X
- **Followers:** 10.3K
- **Following:** 3,252
- **Posts:** 1,978
- **Verified:** Yes
- **Joined:** March 2016

### Content Analysis
- **Posting frequency:** ~1 original post every 3-4 days (too low)
- **Content type:** Product features, Hedera reposts, partnership announcements
- **Tone:** Professional, clean, but generic — reads like press releases

### Engagement (recent posts)
- **Original posts:** ~300-400 views, 20-35 likes (very low for 10K followers = ~3-4% reach)
- **Hedera reposts:** 12K-29K views, 145-320 RTs (30x better performance)
- **Pinned post:** About $MINGO token on SaucerSwap (Jan 15) — 1.6K views, 75 likes

### What Works
- Hedera ecosystem content gets massive amplification
- Clean visuals and branding
- Partnership announcements get decent engagement

### What Doesn't Work
- Feature-description style posts (no hooks, no questions, no storytelling)
- Low posting frequency means algorithm doesn't favor the account
- No threads for bigger announcements
- No community engagement (replies, quote tweets, conversations)
- Pinned post is token-focused rather than product-focused
- No user-generated content or testimonials
- No behind-the-scenes or team personality

### Recommendations for Social Strategy
1. **Post daily** — Mix of original content, ecosystem engagement, and reposts
2. **Content pillars:**
   - Problem/solution (ticketing industry problems → MINGO fixes)
   - Hedera ecosystem news & commentary
   - Partnership spotlights & event recaps
   - Behind-the-scenes / team culture
   - Industry education (NFT ticketing explainers)
   - Community engagement (polls, questions, debates)
3. **Lead with hooks** — First line must grab attention
4. **Use threads** for announcements and explainers
5. **Engage in replies** — Reply to Hedera posts, partner posts, industry conversations
6. **Pin a product-focused post** — Sell the vision, not the token
7. **Visual consistency** — Branded templates for different content types
8. **Quote tweet with commentary** — Don't just retweet, add value
9. **Leverage combat sports angle** — Unique niche, great content potential
10. **User testimonials** — Get organizers/fans to share experiences
