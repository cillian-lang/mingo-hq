**Subject:** Account Statement Request — 2021-2023 (Export Returning No Data)

---

Hi,

I'm writing to request account statements for my Bybit account for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023.

I've tried using the export/download feature on the platform, but it returns "no data found" for those periods despite having had active trading during that time.

Could you please provide full account statements covering all activity (deposits, withdrawals, trades, and any other transactions) for the following periods:

- 1 January 2021 – 31 December 2021
- 1 January 2022 – 31 December 2022
- 1 January 2023 – 31 December 2023

I need these for personal record-keeping and tax purposes.

Happy to verify my identity or provide any additional information needed.

Thanks,
Cillian
