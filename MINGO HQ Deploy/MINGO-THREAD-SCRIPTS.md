## THREAD 1: "Why Hedera?" (Builder Perspective)

**1/8**
🧵 Why we built @mingoapps on @hedera — and why we'd do it again.

A thread for anyone who's ever wondered why a ticketing company chose a hashgraph. 👇

**2/8**
In 2018 we had a simple question:

Which network can verify 10,000 tickets at a venue gate without breaking a sweat?

Ethereum couldn't. Solana didn't exist yet. @hedera could.

**3/8**
Sub-second finality. Not "fast." Literally under one second.

When 10,000 fans are queuing to get in, every millisecond at the scanner counts. We needed speed that was guaranteed, not theoretical.

**4/8**
Fixed, predictable fees.

On Ethereum, gas spikes could make a €5 ticket cost €15 to mint. On @hedera, fees are fractions of a cent. Predictable. Always.

That's how we keep our platform at 3.5%.

**5/8**
Governed by Google, IBM, Boeing, Deutsche Telekom, LG.

When we pitch to event organisers, "our tech runs on a network governed by Fortune 500 companies" hits different than "it's on a blockchain."

**6/8**
Carbon negative.

Events are about bringing people together. We didn't want our infrastructure contributing to the problem. @hedera is one of the most energy-efficient networks in existence. 🌱

**7/8**
71 billion+ transactions processed. More than most L1s combined.

This isn't a testnet. It's production infrastructure. And every @mingoapps ticket adds to that number.

**8/8**
Eight years later, we're in 54 countries, partnered with the WBC, and processing real tickets for real events.

Choosing @hedera was the best technical decision we ever made.

If you're building something real, build it here. ⚡

## THREAD 2: "The Ticketing Industry is Broken" (Problem Thread)

**1/7**
🧵 The ticketing industry is broken. Here's exactly how — and what we're doing about it.

Numbers. Facts. No hype. 👇

**2/7**
The average legacy platform charges 15-27% in fees on every ticket.

On a €75 ticket, that's €11-€20 going to the platform. Not the artist. Not the venue. Not the promoter.

For doing what exactly? Processing a QR code?

**3/7**
12% of U.S. concert ticket buyers have been sold a fake ticket.

Twelve percent. That's millions of fans scammed every year because centralised databases can be manipulated.

On @hedera, every MINGO ticket is cryptographically unique. Can't be faked. Ever. ✅

**4/7**
The secondary ticket market is worth $6.58 BILLION.

Organisers and artists see exactly $0 of that on legacy platforms.

On MINGO, resale royalties are enforced automatically at the smart contract level. Every resale. Every time.

**5/7**
Scalper bots buy thousands of tickets in seconds, then resell at 3-10x markup.

MINGO gives organisers resale price caps. Set a maximum. Enforce it on-chain. Fans pay fair prices. Artists keep control.

**6/7**
So why hasn't anyone fixed this?

Because the broken system is profitable — for the platforms.

27% fees. Zero resale revenue sharing. No fraud accountability.

The incentive to change doesn't exist. Unless someone builds the alternative.

**7/7**
That's what @mingoapps is.

3.5% fees. NFT-verified tickets. Anti-scalping. Artist royalties. 54 countries. Any event size.

Built on @hedera since 2018.

The alternative exists. Now it's about making sure everyone knows it.

## THREAD 3: "What Happens When You Buy a MINGO Ticket" (Education Thread)

**1/6**
🧵 "But I don't understand crypto..."

You don't need to. Here's exactly what happens when you buy a MINGO ticket. Step by step. 👇

**2/6**
Step 1: You find an event on tickets.mingo.com

Looks like any ticketing site. Pick your event. Pick your ticket. Normal.

**3/6**
Step 2: You sign up with your email and pay with your card.

No crypto wallet. No seed phrases. No MetaMask popups. Just... email and card. Like buying anything online.

**4/6**
Step 3: You get a QR code.

Behind the scenes, your ticket is minted as an NFT on @hedera. But you don't see any of that. You see a QR code on your phone. That's it.

**5/6**
Step 4: You show up to the event. QR scans in under a second.

The scanner verifies your ticket on-chain. Confirmed genuine. Confirmed yours. Confirmed not a duplicate. Sub-second.

You walk in.

**6/6**
That's the whole experience.

No crypto. No downloads. No confusion.

The difference? Your ticket can't be faked, the artist earns from resales, and the organiser paid 3.5% instead of 27%.

Web3 that works like Web2. @mingoapps 🎟️

## THREAD 4: "February 2026 — Hedera's Biggest Month" (Timely)

**1/6**
🧵 February 2026 might be @hedera's biggest month ever.

Let's break down what just happened — and why it matters for real-world blockchain adoption. 👇

**2/6**
Australia's AUDD stablecoin got FULL regulatory approval from ASIC — and chose Hedera as their settlement layer.

A regulated, government-recognised stablecoin. On Hedera. That's not crypto speculation. That's financial infrastructure. 🇦🇺

**3/6**
Archax is minting tokenized BlackRock and State Street money market fund tokens on Hedera.

BlackRock. The world's largest asset manager. Choosing Hedera for tokenization.

Read that again.

**4/6**
Hedera joined the Digital Monetary Institute — a central bank policy forum.

Central banks are now at the table with Hedera. The conversation has shifted from "is this real?" to "how do we implement this?"

**5/6**
Hedera is leading February's real-world asset development rankings. Ahead of Chainlink. Ahead of Avalanche.

71 billion+ transactions processed. More than most L1s combined.

**6/6**
This is the network @mingoapps has been building on since 2018.

Regulated stablecoins. Institutional funds. Central bank engagement. And real event tickets verified at venue gates.

When people ask "does Hedera have real utility?" — point them here. ⚡
