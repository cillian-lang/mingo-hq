**Posting Guidelines:**
- Tag @hedera on all Hedera-related content (drives ecosystem amplification)

## PILLAR 1: PROBLEM/SOLUTION

### Draft 1 — The Fee Problem

Ticketmaster charges an average of 27% of the ticket price in service fees.

On a $75 ticket, that's over $20 going to the platform — not the artist, not the venue.

MINGO charges 3.5%. Total.

That's not a small difference. On a 10,000-seat event at $75/ticket, organizers save over $175,000 in fees alone.

### Draft 2 — The Fraud Problem

12% of concert ticket buyers in the U.S. have purchased a ticket that turned out to be fake.

With 94 million Americans attending live music events annually, that's over 11 million people scammed.

Every MINGO ticket is minted as an NFT on @hedera. It can't be duplicated, screenshotted, or forged. Verified on-chain at the door in under a second.

### Draft 3 — The Scalping Problem

The global secondary ticket market is worth $6.58 billion. Secondary platforms charge 10–25% on top of already inflated prices.

MINGO gives organizers control:
→ Set maximum resale prices
→ Earn a commission on every legitimate resale
→ Track exactly who holds every ticket in real time

The revenue stays with the people who created the event — not the bots who exploited it.

### Draft 4 — The Dead Ticket

A traditional ticket gets you through the door. Then it's worthless.

A MINGO ticket is programmable. After the event, it can carry:
→ A personal message from the performer
→ A clip of exclusive live content
→ A discount code for the next event
→ A digital collectible — proof you were there

The ticket becomes part of the experience, not just the entry pass.

## PILLAR 2: HEDERA ECOSYSTEM

### Draft 5 — Why We Build on Hedera

Why @hedera instead of Ethereum or Solana?

For ticketing, the chain needs to do four things well:

1. Finality in seconds — Tickets must validate instantly at venue gates. Hedera settles in 3–5 seconds.
2. Predictable fees — Gas spikes can't be passed to ticket buyers. Hedera's fees are fixed at fractions of a cent.
3. High throughput — A stadium sellout means thousands of simultaneous transactions. Hedera handles 10,000+ TPS.
4. Enterprise trust — Hedera's governing council includes Google, IBM, Boeing, and Deutsche Telekom.

We've been building here since 2018 — one of the earliest projects on the network.

### Draft 6 — Real-World NFT Utility

The narrative says NFTs are dead.

Meanwhile, across 54 countries, real people are using NFT tickets to attend real events — boxing matches, MMA fights, concerts, conventions.

No speculation. No floor prices. No flipping.

Just tickets that prove they're authentic, prevent fraud, and give fans something worth keeping after the show.

This is what utility looks like when you build for the real world.

---

## PILLAR 3: PARTNERSHIPS & TRACTION

### Draft 7 — Combat Sports

MINGO is building the ticketing infrastructure for combat sports worldwide.

Current partners:
→ World Boxing Council (WBC)
→ WBC Muay Thai
→ African Boxing League
→ Yucateco Boxing League
→ Fight Circus
→ NUCA MMA
→ Goldstar Promotions

Combat sports have some of the worst scalping and fraud problems in live events. High demand, limited seats, passionate fans willing to pay anything.

That's exactly where secure, verifiable ticketing matters most.

---

### Draft 8 — 54 Countries

In January 2026, MINGO's ticketing infrastructure went live across 54 countries.

Not a roadmap item. Not a projection. Operational.

The partnerships with the African Boxing League and Yucateco Boxing League alone span most of Africa and Latin America.

NFT ticketing isn't a concept anymore. It's infrastructure.

## PILLAR 4: EDUCATION

### Draft 9 — NFT Ticketing Explainer (Thread)

What is an NFT ticket? A thread for people who don't care about crypto but do care about not getting scammed. 🧵

1/ A regular ticket is a QR code. Anyone can screenshot it, copy it, sell it five times. The venue has no way to know which one is real until someone gets turned away at the door.

2/ An NFT ticket is a unique digital asset recorded on a public ledger. There's only one, it's tied to one owner, and its entire history is visible and verifiable.

3/ With MINGO, buying one works like buying any other ticket online. You don't need a crypto wallet or any blockchain knowledge. Email login, card payment, done.

4/ At the venue, the ticket is verified against the blockchain in real time. Authentic? You're in. Duplicate? Flagged instantly.

5/ After the event, the ticket stays in your digital collection. Some carry exclusive content — artist messages, event footage, future discounts. It's a memory, not a disposable QR code.

6/ For organizers: 3.5% platform fees (vs industry standard 15–27%), full control over resale pricing, commissions from secondary sales, and real-time data on every ticket holder.

### Draft 10 — Market Opportunity

The global online event ticketing market was valued at $51 billion in 2024 and is growing at ~5% annually.

The NFT ticketing segment alone is projected to reach $7.8 billion by 2033, growing at 24.8% CAGR.

This isn't a niche. It's the future of how events work.

## PILLAR 5: ENGAGEMENT

### Draft 11 — Poll

For event organizers:

What's the single biggest problem with your current ticketing platform?

🔴 Fees are too high
🟡 Fraud / counterfeit tickets
🟢 No control over resale
🔵 No useful data on attendees

---

### Draft 12 — Conversation Starter

Genuine question: what's the most you've ever been charged in "service fees" on a single ticket?

---

### Draft 13 — Hot Take

Ticketmaster takes ~27% of every ticket in fees while adding zero value to the event itself.

The DOJ filed an antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation/Ticketmaster in 2024. The industry knows the model is broken.

The only question is what replaces it.

---

## PILLAR 6: BRAND & CULTURE

### Draft 14 — The Long Game

Most web3 projects launched during the 2021 bull run.

MINGO has been building on @hedera since 2018 — through the bear market, through the "NFTs are dead" headlines, through every cycle.

Real infrastructure isn't built in bull markets. It's proven in them.

---

### Draft 15 — Compliance as a Feature

MINGO is registered in Gibraltar — one of the world's most established crypto-regulatory jurisdictions.

When you're processing tickets across 54 countries, regulatory compliance isn't optional. It's the foundation everything else sits on.

## NOTES FOR POSTING

- Each draft is standalone but can be adapted into threads by expanding key points
- Stats should be turned into branded visual cards (clean, minimal, MINGO colours)
- The fee comparison (3.5% vs 27%) is the single most powerful stat — use it often but in different contexts
- Combat sports content resonates with a specific, highly engaged audience — worth its own mini-strategy
- Hedera ecosystem tags are the highest-ROI engagement tactic based on current analytics
