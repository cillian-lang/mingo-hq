# MINGO — Brand Voice & Style Guide

*Compiled: 2026-02-12 | For consistent messaging across all platforms*

---

## BRAND IDENTITY

**What MINGO is:** A ticketing platform for any event, any size, anywhere. Built on Hedera blockchain but invisible to the end user.

**What MINGO is NOT:**
- Not a crypto project trying to sell tokens
- Not a combat sports company (that's one vertical of many)
- Not "Web3 ticketing for crypto people" — it's ticketing for everyone
- Not experimental — live since 2018, 54 countries

---

## VOICE CHARACTERISTICS

**Confident, not arrogant**
- ✅ "We charge 3.5%. The industry charges 27%. The maths speaks for itself."
- ❌ "We're the best ticketing platform ever built."

**Direct, not aggressive**
- ✅ "Legacy ticketing is broken. Here's how we fix it."
- ❌ "Ticketmaster is a scam and they're robbing you."

**Technical credibility, simple language**
- ✅ "Every ticket is verified on-chain in under a second."
- ❌ "Our NFTs leverage Hedera Token Service's deterministic finality via hashgraph consensus."

**Inclusive, not exclusive**
- ✅ "Works for any event — 10 people or 100,000."
- ❌ "For serious event professionals only."

**Builder mentality**
- ✅ "Building since 2018. Shipping since 2018."
- ❌ "We're going to revolutionize the industry someday."

## TONE BY PLATFORM

**X / Twitter**
- Punchy, direct, conversational
- Lead with hooks — first line must grab
- Use stats and numbers (they stop the scroll)
- 1-2 hashtags max (more hurts reach)
- Emojis: sparingly, for emphasis (⚡🎟️✅🔥)
- Engage in replies — be human, not corporate
- Quote tweet with takes, don't just retweet

**LinkedIn**
- Professional but not stiff
- Thought leadership angle
- Personal perspective (each team member has their own voice)
- Longer form OK — tell stories
- End with a takeaway or question
- Hashtags: 3-5 at the bottom

**Email outreach**
- Brief, respectful of their time
- Lead with the fee savings (concrete numbers for their specific event size)
- No jargon, no blockchain talk
- End with a soft CTA (call, demo, or "have a look")

## KEY PHRASES — USE THESE

- "3.5% fees" (always lead with the number)
- "Any event, any size, any country"
- "Built on Hedera since 2018"
- "No crypto needed"
- "Legacy ticketing" (never name specific competitors for legal reasons)
- "Verified on-chain"
- "Real events, real tickets, real savings"
- "From 10 people to 100,000"
- "Fair ticketing"
- "The alternative exists"

## KEY PHRASES — AVOID THESE

- ❌ "Ticketmaster" or any specific competitor by name
- ❌ "Revolutionary" / "disrupting" / "game-changing" (overused)
- ❌ "Web3" in consumer-facing content (use in crypto community only)
- ❌ "NFT" when talking to non-crypto audiences (say "verified digital ticket")
- ❌ "Blockchain" as a selling point to consumers (it's invisible, remember)
- ❌ "Moon" / "WAGMI" / crypto slang (we're a real business)
- ❌ "Coming soon" / "roadmap" (we ship, we don't promise)

**Imagery:**
- Phone mockups showing the app
- Dark backgrounds with green/orange accents
- Real event photography where possible

## CONTENT RULES

1. **Every tweet needs a hook** — If the first line doesn't make someone stop scrolling, rewrite it
2. **Numbers > adjectives** — "3.5%" beats "low fees" every time
3. **Show, don't tell** — Fee calculations > vague claims about being cheaper
4. **One message per post** — Don't try to say everything at once
5. **End with something** — A question, a CTA, a stat, a punchline. Never fade out.
6. **280 characters for tweets** — Hard limit. No threads to continue a thought that should've been one tweet.
7. **No legal risk** — Don't name competitors, don't make claims we can't back up
8. **Proofread** — Every typo undermines credibility

## HASHTAG STRATEGY

**X (use 1-2 max):**
- #Hedera — always when relevant
- #HBAR — for ecosystem engagement
- #EventTech — industry positioning

**LinkedIn (use 3-5):**
- #EventTech #Ticketing #Hedera #Web3 #LiveEvents #Blockchain #Marketing

**Never use:**
- #NFT (stigma in mainstream audiences)
- #Crypto (same)
- #ToTheMoon (we're a business)
