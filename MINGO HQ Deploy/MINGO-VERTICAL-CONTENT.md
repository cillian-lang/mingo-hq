## TWEETS — BY VERTICAL

### 🎵 Music (Festivals, Gigs, Club Nights)

**Tweet M1 — Festival Fees**
Festival ticket: €80.
Legacy platform "service fee": €21.
That's 27% gone before you even get through the gate.

MINGO: €2.80. Total.

Same ticket. Same festival. 87% less fees. 🎵

**Tweet M2 — Artist Revenue**
Every time a fan resells your concert ticket on a legacy platform, you earn nothing.

On MINGO, artists earn royalties on every single resale. Automatically. On-chain.

Your music. Your fans. Your revenue. 🎶

**Tweet M3 — Indie Venues**
Small venue. 200 capacity. €15 tickets.

Legacy platforms still take their 27%. That's €810 gone on a single night.

MINGO: €105. Same gig. €705 more for the venue, the artist, the sound guy.

Every euro counts. 🎸

### 😂 Comedy

**Tweet C1 — Comedy Scene**
The comedy scene is booming. Independent promoters are selling out venues every week.

So why are they still handing 27% of their ticket revenue to legacy platforms?

3.5% fees. No contracts. Any venue size. @mingoapps 😂

**Tweet C2 — Comedy Club**
200-seat comedy night. €20 tickets. Sold out.

Legacy platform takes: €1,080
MINGO takes: €140

That's €940 back. Enough to book another headliner. Or fix the sound system. Or both. 🎤

### 🎭 Theatre & Arts

**Tweet T1 — Community Theatre**
Community theatres run on razor-thin margins.

Losing 15-27% of ticket revenue to a platform isn't just unfair — it's existential.

MINGO: 3.5%. Built for every stage, every size. 🎭

**Tweet T2 — Arts Funding**
Every euro that goes to legacy platform fees is a euro that doesn't go to production, performers, or the arts.

MINGO keeps 96.5% in the hands of the people who made the show happen. 🎨

### 🏟️ Sports (Beyond Combat)

**Tweet S1 — Local Sports**
Your local GAA club, rugby match, or athletics event deserves the same ticketing tech as a stadium concert.

MINGO scales from 10 tickets to 100,000. Same 3.5%. Same anti-fraud. Same tech.

Every event matters. ⚽

**Tweet S2 — Sports Clubs**
Sports clubs shouldn't need enterprise contracts and 27% fees just to sell tickets to a weekend match.

MINGO: set up in minutes, 3.5% fees, works on any phone. From grassroots to stadiums. 🏟️

---

### 💼 Conferences & Corporate

**Tweet CF1 — Conferences**
Conference organisers: you're paying for a legacy ticketing platform AND building your own registration system on top of it.

MINGO does both. 3.5%. No bloat. No contracts. Just tickets that work. 📊

**Tweet CF2 — Web3 Events**
If you're running a Web3 event and still selling tickets through a Web2 platform...

What are we even doing here? 

@mingoapps. Blockchain-native. 3.5%. Built on @hedera. 🤝

### 🎉 Community & Charity

**Tweet CH1 — Charity Events**
Charity fundraiser. Every euro counts.

Legacy platforms: 27% of your ticket sales goes to the platform.
MINGO: 3.5%.

When you're raising money for a cause, your ticketing platform shouldn't be the biggest expense. 💚

**Tweet CH2 — Local Events**
Local market. School fundraiser. Community festival. Club AGM.

MINGO isn't just for big events. It's for any event where fair pricing matters.

No app download. No minimum. 3.5%. tickets.mingo.com 🌍

### 🍽️ Food & Drink

**Tweet F1 — Food Festivals**
Food festival. Wine tasting. Pop-up dinner. Craft beer event.

These are passion projects. The margins are tight.

Don't hand 27% to a ticketing platform. MINGO: 3.5%. Every ticket, every event. 🍷

### 🌙 Nightlife

**Tweet N1 — Club Events**
Club promoters: you already deal with enough overhead.

Door list drama. Fake tickets. No-shows.

MINGO: QR-verified entry, anti-fraud NFT tickets, 3.5% fees. Built for the pace of nightlife. 🌙

**Tweet N2 — DJ Events**
DJ night. 500 capacity. €15 entry.

Legacy platform: €2,025 in fees.
MINGO: €262.

That's €1,763. An extra headline act. Better sound. Actual profit. 🎧

### 🔄 Universal / Event-Agnostic

**Tweet U1 — Any Event**
10 people or 100,000. Workshop or stadium tour.

MINGO doesn't care what your event is. We care that you stop overpaying for tickets.

3.5%. Any event. Any size. Any country. 🌍

**Tweet U2 — The Platform**
Legacy ticketing was built for stadiums and lock-in contracts.

MINGO was built for everyone. The comedian doing 50-seat shows. The festival doing 50,000. The charity doing their annual fundraiser.

Same platform. Same fees. Same tech. 🎟️

**Tweet U3 — No Minimum**
No minimum ticket sales. No annual contracts. No exclusivity deals.

Set up your event. Sell tickets. Pay 3.5%.

That's the whole pitch. @mingoapps ⚡

**Tweet U4 — The Real Question**
"What kind of events does MINGO support?"

All of them.

Boxing. Comedy. Music. Theatre. Conferences. Charity. Nightlife. Food festivals. Sports.

If people need tickets, MINGO works. 3.5%. Built on @hedera. 🎟️

### Joe Arthur — CEO

**The Platform for Every Event**

People sometimes ask me: "Is MINGO a combat sports ticketing platform?"

No. MINGO is an everything ticketing platform.

We've built partnerships with the WBC and Fight Circus because combat sports promoters understood the value proposition fastest. Fighters and promoters know what it means to lose 27% of your gate to a platform.

But the technology doesn't care what's on stage. A comedy club with 200 seats gets the same benefits as a 50,000-seat stadium: 3.5% fees, NFT-verified tickets, anti-scalping controls, and artist royalties on resale.

We're now expanding into music, conferences, theatre, community events, and nightlife. The product is the same. The savings are the same. The only difference is that more industries are waking up to the fact that they've been overpaying for decades.

If you sell tickets to anything — we built this for you.

### Deirdre Arthur — President

**Every Euro Matters**

One thing I've learned building MINGO: the smaller the event, the more the fees hurt.

A stadium tour can absorb 27% in platform fees. It's painful, but survivable.

A community theatre group? A charity fundraiser? A local comedy night? Those margins are razor-thin. Losing a quarter of your ticket revenue to a platform can be the difference between breaking even and shutting down.

That's why MINGO charges 3.5% regardless of event size. No minimums. No contracts. No tiered pricing that punishes small organisers.

The biggest events get the headlines. But the smallest events are where fair ticketing matters most.

**Beyond Boxing**

If you only know MINGO from our combat sports partnerships — you're seeing about 10% of what we do.

Yes, we work with the WBC, Fight Circus, and boxing promoters across 54 countries. That's our flagship vertical and we're proud of it.

But here's what a lot of people don't realise: the same platform that handles a world title fight handles a 50-person comedy night. Same tech. Same 3.5%. Same anti-fraud.

We're actively expanding into music, theatre, conferences, nightlife, and community events. If you're an organiser in any of these spaces and you're still paying 15-27% to a legacy platform — let's talk.

The product speaks for itself. I just need to make sure more people hear it.

**Scaling Without Compromise**

One of the technical challenges we've solved at MINGO: making the platform work identically whether you're scanning 50 tickets at a comedy club or 50,000 at a stadium.

On legacy platforms, smaller events often get a stripped-down version of the product. Enterprise features are locked behind premium tiers.

On MINGO, every event gets: NFT ticket verification on Hedera, sub-second gate scanning, resale price controls, and full analytics. Whether you sell 10 tickets or 100,000.

Hedera's architecture makes this possible. Fixed fees mean we don't need to tier-gate features based on volume. The economics work at every scale.

That's what building on the right infrastructure gives you: the freedom to serve everyone equally.
