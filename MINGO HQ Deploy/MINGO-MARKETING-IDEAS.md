# MINGO — Marketing Ideas & Recommendations

*Compiled: 2026-02-12 by Adam*
*Ideas beyond the current content calendar to accelerate MINGO's growth*

---

## 🔥 HIGH IMPACT (Do These First)

### 1. Hedera Ecosystem Engagement Blitz
The data is clear: Hedera-tagged content gets 30x more reach. This is the single biggest growth lever right now.

**Action plan:**
- Identify top 20 Hedera ecosystem accounts to engage with daily
- Reply thoughtfully to @hedera, @SaucerSwapLabs, @HashPackApp, and other ecosystem posts
- Quote tweet Hedera news with MINGO's perspective
- Tag @hedera in every relevant post (not forced — natural)
- Goal: become the most visible ticketing project in the Hedera ecosystem

### 2. "3.5% vs 27%" Campaign
This single stat is MINGO's most powerful marketing weapon. Build an entire micro-campaign around it.

**Action plan:**
- Branded stat card graphic (dark bg, green accent, bold typography)
- Thread breaking down the math for different venue sizes
- Video/animation showing the fee comparison visually
- Pin this as the core message across all platforms

### 3. Case Study Content from Real Events
Nothing sells like proof. Get testimonials and data from actual MINGO-ticketed events.

**Action plan:**
- Contact 3-5 event organizers who've used MINGO
- Get quotes, ticket numbers, satisfaction data
- Create case study posts for LinkedIn and threads for X
- Even short quotes like "We saved £X on fees" are gold

### 4. Joe Arthur as Thought Leader on LinkedIn
Joe's LinkedIn presence should be a top priority. CEOs with active LinkedIn profiles generate massive credibility for their companies.

**Action plan:**
- Post 3-4 times per week from Joe's personal profile
- Mix of industry commentary, MINGO milestones, and founder insights
- Engage with Hedera and event industry posts from Joe's account
- LinkedIn algorithm heavily favors personal profiles over company pages

## 📈 MEDIUM IMPACT (Build These Out)

### 5. Combat Sports Content Vertical
MINGO's niche in combat sports is a huge untapped content opportunity.

**Ideas:**
- Event countdown graphics for MINGO-ticketed fights
- Behind-the-scenes content from events
- Fighter spotlights (with MINGO branding)
- "Fight Night powered by MINGO" branded content series
- Engage with boxing/MMA accounts and journalists

### 6. Educational Thread Series
Weekly threads demystifying NFT ticketing for mainstream audiences.

**Thread topics:**
- "What actually happens when you buy a MINGO ticket" (step by step)
- "How blockchain kills ticket fraud — explained simply"
- "Why artists should care about secondary market royalties"
- "The history of ticketing and why it's ready for disruption"
- "NFT tickets vs regular tickets — what's actually different?"

### 7. Comparison Content
Direct, factual comparisons that highlight MINGO's advantages.

**Ideas:**
- "MINGO vs Ticketmaster: A fee breakdown" (infographic)
- "NFT ticketing platforms compared" (positioning MINGO as the leader)
- "Web2 vs Web3 ticketing: what changes for fans" (educational)

### 8. Email Newsletter
A monthly newsletter to event organizers and industry contacts.

**Content:**
- MINGO updates and new features
- Industry news and commentary
- Case studies
- Special offers for new organizers

### 9. Telegram Community Growth
Build the Telegram community into an active engagement hub.

**Ideas:**

## 🧪 EXPERIMENTAL (Worth Testing)

### 10. Short-Form Video Content

### 11. Podcast Appearances
Get Joe and Jason on crypto/web3/event industry podcasts.

**Target podcasts:**
- Hedera ecosystem podcasts

### 12. Strategic Twitter Spaces
Host or co-host Spaces on topics like:
- "Is Ticketmaster's monopoly really ending?"

- Co-host with other Hedera ecosystem projects

### 13. Influencer Partnerships
Partner with:
- Hedera community influencers

### 14. PR Push
The 54-country deal got solid press coverage. Keep the momentum:

### 15. Referral Program for Organizers
