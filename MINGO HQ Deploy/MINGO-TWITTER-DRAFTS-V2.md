## PILLAR 1: PROBLEM/SOLUTION

**Tweet 1 — The Fee Killer**
Legacy ticketing platforms charge up to 27% in fees on your ticket.

We charge 3.5%.

That's not a typo. That's @mingoapps on @hedera. 🎟️

**Tweet 2 — Fraud Stat**
12% of U.S. concert ticket buyers have been sold a fake ticket.

Every MINGO ticket is an NFT on @hedera — verified on-chain, impossible to counterfeit.

No more scams. ✅

**Tweet 3 — The Math**
10,000 seat venue. $75 tickets.

With legacy platforms: $202,500 in fees.
With MINGO: $26,250 in fees.

That's $176,250 back in the organizer's pocket. Every. Single. Event.

**Tweet 4 — Scalping**
Scalpers bought your ticket before you even opened the page.

With MINGO, organizers set resale price caps. Fans pay fair prices. Artists keep control.

Blockchain-verified. Built on @hedera.

**Tweet 5 — Secondary Market**
The secondary ticket market is worth $6.58B.

Organizers and artists see $0 of that on legacy platforms.

With MINGO, they earn royalties on every resale. Automatically. On-chain.

## PILLAR 2: HEDERA ECOSYSTEM

**Tweet 6 — Why Hedera**
Why did we build on @hedera?

⚡ Sub-second finality
💰 Predictable low fees
🏢 Governed by Google, IBM, Boeing
🌱 Carbon negative

When you're scanning 10,000 tickets at a venue door, speed isn't optional.

**Tweet 7 — Builder Cred**
We've been building on @hedera since 2018.

Before the hype. Before the bull runs. Before most people knew what hashgraph was.

Real builders ship. 🚢

**Tweet 8 — Hedera Stats**
@hedera processes 10,000+ TPS with sub-second finality.

That means your ticket gets verified at the gate faster than you can pull out your phone.

This is why we build here. ⚡

**Tweet 9 — Enterprise Grade**
@hedera's governing council includes Google, IBM, Boeing, LG, and Deutsche Telekom.

That's not a crypto project. That's enterprise infrastructure.

And it's what powers every @mingoapps ticket. 🎟️

## PILLAR 3: PARTNERSHIPS & TRACTION

**Tweet 10 — 54 Countries**

Combat sports chose MINGO because fighters deserve better than legacy fees.

## PILLAR 4: EDUCATION

**Tweet 13 — NFT Tickets Explained**
"But I don't understand crypto..."

You don't need to.

Web3 shouldn't feel like homework. 📱

✅ Can't be faked

✅ Resale is controlled

## PILLAR 5: ENGAGEMENT

**Tweet 16 — Poll**
What annoys you MOST about buying event tickets?

🔴 Hidden fees
🟡 Scalper bots
🟢 Fake tickets
🔵 No refund options

**Tweet 17 — Question**
If event organizers could save 80% on ticketing fees AND eliminate fraud...

Why wouldn't they?

Asking for @mingoapps. 👀

**Tweet 18 — Hot Take**
Hot take: Legacy ticketing's biggest moat isn't the tech. It's that organizers don't know there's an alternative.

We're changing that. One event at a time. @mingoapps 🎟️
