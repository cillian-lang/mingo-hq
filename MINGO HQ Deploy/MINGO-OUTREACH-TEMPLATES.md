## UNIVERSAL TEMPLATE (Adapt per vertical)

**Subject:** Save 80% on ticketing fees — quick question

Hi [Name],

I'm Cillian from MINGO — we're a ticketing platform built on enterprise blockchain (Hedera, governed by Google, IBM, Boeing).

Quick pitch: we charge **3.5% per ticket**. That's it. No service fees, no processing fees, no hidden charges. The industry average is 15-27%.

For a [event size]-person event at €[price] per ticket, that's **€[savings] saved** compared to what you're likely paying now.

We already work with the World Boxing Council, Fight Circus, Comic-Con Ireland, and event organisers across 54 countries.

The platform works like any modern ticketing system — your attendees don't need to know anything about blockchain. Email signup, card payment, QR code at the door. Simple.

Would you be open to a 10-minute call to see if it's a fit?

## MUSIC VENUES & PROMOTERS

**Subject:** Your venue could save €[X] per show on ticketing

Hi [Name],

I came across [Venue Name] and love what you're doing with your lineup.

Quick question: how much are you paying in ticketing fees right now? Most venues we talk to are losing 15-27% per ticket to their platform.

At MINGO, we charge 3.5%. For a 500-cap venue at €20 a ticket, that's:
- Legacy platform: €2,700 in fees
- MINGO: €350 in fees
- You save: **€2,350 per sold-out show**

Multiply that across a year of shows and it adds up fast.

The platform is modern, mobile-friendly, no app download needed. Your punters won't notice any difference — except maybe the lower price.

We work with events from 50-person club nights to festivals. Currently live in 54 countries with partners including the WBC and Comic-Con Ireland.

Happy to give you a quick demo if you're curious.

## COMEDY PROMOTERS

**Subject:** Comedy night ticketing — 3.5% fees, no catch

Hi [Name],

Big fan of what you're building with [Show/Venue Name]. The Irish comedy scene is having a moment.

I run marketing at MINGO — we're a ticketing platform that charges 3.5% flat. No service fees, no booking fees, no platform tax.

For a typical 200-seat comedy night at €15 a ticket:
- Legacy platforms take: ~€810
- MINGO takes: €105
- **You keep an extra €705 per show**

That's another headliner. Or actual profit margins.

The tech is seamless — attendees buy with their card, get a QR code, show up. No app downloads, no crypto, no complications.

We're already working with events across 54 countries. Would love to show you how it works for comedy specifically.

5-minute call?

## CONFERENCE / CORPORATE EVENTS

**Subject:** Conference ticketing at 3.5% — worth a look?

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Conference Name] is coming up and wanted to reach out.

We're MINGO — a ticketing platform that charges 3.5% per ticket. For context, most platforms in this space charge 6-15%, and that's before payment processing fees.

For a 1,000-person conference at €150/ticket:
- Typical platform fees: €15,000-€22,500
- MINGO fees: €5,250
- **Savings: €10,000-€17,000 per event**

The platform handles registration, QR verification, and works on any device — no app needed. Your attendees get a clean, professional experience.

We're built on Hedera (enterprise blockchain governed by Google, IBM, Boeing), which means every ticket is verified and fraud-proof. Especially relevant for high-value conference passes.

Currently serving events across 54 countries. Happy to walk you through a quick demo.

## CHARITY / COMMUNITY EVENTS

**Subject:** More money for your cause, less for your ticketing platform

Hi [Name],

I saw [Event/Organisation Name] and the work you're doing — really impressive.

Quick thought: if you're using a ticketing platform for your events, you're probably losing 15-27% of each ticket sale to fees. For a charity or community org, that's money that should be going to your cause.

MINGO charges 3.5%. That's it.

For a 300-person fundraiser at €25/ticket:
- Legacy platform takes: ~€2,025
- MINGO takes: €262
- **€1,763 more goes to your cause**

No contracts, no minimums, no hidden charges. Works on any phone, any browser. Your supporters just buy a ticket and show up.

Would love to help you keep more of what you raise.

## NIGHTLIFE / CLUB PROMOTERS

**Subject:** Club ticketing — 3.5%, verified entry, zero fakes

Hi [Name],

Running nights in [City]? Two things that probably cost you money: fake tickets and platform fees.

MINGO solves both. Every ticket is cryptographically verified (no fakes, ever) and we charge 3.5%. That's roughly 80% less than what most promoters pay.

For a 500-capacity night at €15:
- Legacy platform: €2,025 in fees
- MINGO: €262
- **€1,763 saved per event**

The entry system is QR-based, works on any phone, and scans in under a second. No app downloads for your crowd. Fast queue, no drama.

Currently powering events across 54 countries. Happy to show you a quick demo.

## SPORTS CLUBS (GAA, Rugby, Local)

**Subject:** Ticketing for [Club Name] — save 80% on fees

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out to sports clubs across Ireland about a better way to handle ticketing.

Most clubs either use a platform that takes 15-27% per ticket, or they're still doing cash at the gate. Both cost you.

MINGO: 3.5% per ticket, QR entry, works on any phone. No app needed.

For a typical match day — 800 people at €10:
- Legacy platform: €2,160 in fees
- MINGO: €280
- **€1,880 back in the club's pocket**

We work with the World Boxing Council and events in 54 countries, but we built this to work for any event — including your Saturday match.

Worth a quick chat?

## FOLLOW-UP TEMPLATE (For any vertical)

**Subject:** Re: [Original subject] — quick follow-up

Hi [Name],

Just following up on my note from [date]. 

No pressure at all — I know you're busy. The short version:

- 3.5% ticketing fees (vs 15-27% industry average)
- No contracts, no minimums
- Works on any phone, no app download
- Fraud-proof tickets

If the timing's better down the line, I'm here. Otherwise, tickets.mingo.com if you want to have a look yourself.

Cheers,
Cillian
