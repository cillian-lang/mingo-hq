# MINGO — Social Media Profile Optimization

*Compiled: 2026-02-12 | Recommendations for @mingoapps and team profiles*

---

## @mingoapps X PROFILE

### Current Issues
- Bio likely focuses on token/crypto angle
- Pinned post is about $MINGO on SaucerSwap (token-focused, not product-focused)
- Following 3,252 accounts (too many — looks like follow-for-follow)

### Recommended Bio
**Option A (Product-first):**
Event ticketing. 3.5% fees. 54 countries. Built on @hedera since 2018.
Any event. Any size. Fair pricing.
🎟️ tickets.mingo.com

**Option B (Problem-first):**
Legacy ticketing charges 27%. We charge 3.5%.
NFT tickets on @hedera — verified, anti-scalp, artist royalties.
54 countries. Any event size.
🎟️ tickets.mingo.com

**Option C (Bold):**
The ticketing industry is broken. We're fixing it.
3.5% fees | NFT-verified | 54 countries | Built on @hedera
🎟️ tickets.mingo.com

### Recommended Pinned Post
Replace the token-focused pin with one of the pinned post options (A, B, or C) from the Telegraph doc. Product > token for first impressions.

### Profile Actions
- Unfollow inactive/irrelevant accounts (get ratio closer to 1:2 or 1:3 following:followers)
- Add location: "54 Countries 🌍" or "Gibraltar 🇬🇮 | 54 Countries"
- Header image: Clean branded graphic showing the app + "3.5% fees" stat
