# MINGO — Organizer FAQ

*Compiled: 2026-02-12 | Answers to the questions every organizer asks*

---

## FEES & PRICING

**Q: What does MINGO charge?**
3.5% of the ticket face value. That's it. No service fees, no processing fees, no hidden charges, no monthly subscription.

**Q: How does 3.5% compare to other platforms?**
- Legacy platforms (the big names): 15-27%
- Eventbrite: 6.9% + €0.79 per ticket
- Dice: ~10%
- MINGO: 3.5%

On a €50 ticket, MINGO charges €1.75. Legacy platforms charge €7.50-€13.50. The savings add up fast.

**Q: Are there any other costs?**
No setup fees, no monthly fees, no minimum ticket requirements, no contracts. You pay 3.5% when tickets sell. That's the entire cost structure.

**Q: Who pays the fee — the organizer or the ticket buyer?**
That's up to you. You can absorb the 3.5% or pass it on to the buyer. Either way, it's dramatically less than what legacy platforms charge.

**Q: What currencies do you support?**
We support major fiat currencies. Buyers pay with their regular debit/credit card. No crypto needed.

## HOW IT WORKS

**Q: How do I set up an event?**
Sign up with your email, create your event (name, date, venue, ticket types, pricing), and publish. Tickets are live immediately. Takes about 5 minutes.

**Q: Do my customers need to download an app?**
No. MINGO is a progressive web app (PWA). It works in any mobile browser on any phone. No app store, no download, no friction.

**Q: Do my customers need to know anything about blockchain or crypto?**
Absolutely not. The user experience is: pick event → buy ticket with card → receive QR code → scan at door. The blockchain verification happens invisibly behind the scenes.

**Q: How does entry/scanning work?**
Each ticket has a unique QR code. At the door, you scan it with any phone or tablet running our scanner. Verification takes under 1 second. The system confirms the ticket is genuine, hasn't been used, and belongs to the right person.

**Q: Can I sell different ticket types (VIP, early bird, general admission)?**
Yes. Create as many ticket types as you need with different prices and quantities.

**Q: Is there a minimum or maximum event size?**
No minimum. No maximum. We've handled events from 10 people to large-scale international events. The tech scales.

**Q: What about reserved seating / seat maps?**
This is not currently available. We're working on it. For now, MINGO works best for general admission events. If you need assigned seating, let us know your timeline and we can discuss.

## SECURITY & FRAUD

**Q: How does MINGO prevent fake tickets?**
Every ticket is minted as an NFT (non-fungible token) on the Hedera network. This means each ticket is cryptographically unique and verifiable. It literally cannot be duplicated or faked. When scanned at the door, the system checks the blockchain in real-time.

**Q: What about scalping?**
You set the rules. MINGO lets you cap resale prices — for example, no more than 110% of face value. This is enforced at the smart contract level, meaning it can't be bypassed. Fans pay fair prices.

**Q: Can tickets be transferred or resold?**
Yes, through the MINGO platform. You control whether resale is allowed, and at what price cap. If a ticket is resold, you (the organiser) automatically receive a royalty on the resale. Every time.

**Q: What if someone screenshots another person's QR code?**
Won't work. Each ticket is tied to a specific account and verified on-chain. A screenshot doesn't transfer ownership. The scanner will reject it.

## RESALE & ROYALTIES

**Q: How do resale royalties work?**
When you create an event, you set a resale royalty percentage. If a ticket is resold through MINGO, that percentage automatically goes to you. This is enforced by smart contract — no manual tracking, no honour system.

**Q: What's a typical royalty percentage?**
That's up to you. Many organisers set 5-15% of the resale price. For the first time, you earn from secondary market activity instead of losing it entirely.

**Q: Is resale only through MINGO?**
Resale is managed through the MINGO platform to ensure price caps and royalties are enforced. Tickets can't be resold on external secondary marketplaces (which is a feature, not a bug — it's how we prevent scalping).

## TECHNOLOGY

**Q: What is Hedera?**
Hedera is a public distributed ledger (similar to blockchain) governed by major global enterprises including Google, IBM, Boeing, Deutsche Telekom, and LG. It processes over 10,000 transactions per second with sub-second finality. It's carbon negative. It's the infrastructure that powers MINGO's ticket verification.

**Q: Do I need to understand blockchain to use MINGO?**
No. You create events and sell tickets through a normal web interface. The blockchain works behind the scenes.

**Q: What about data privacy?**
We comply with GDPR and relevant data protection regulations. Customer data is handled securely. The blockchain stores ticket verification data, not personal information.

**Q: What happens if the internet goes down at my venue?**
The scanning system has offline capabilities for temporary network interruptions. For extended outages, we have contingency protocols. Contact us for venue-specific setup guidance.

## BUSINESS

**Q: Is there a contract or lock-in period?**
No contracts. No lock-in. Use MINGO for one event or a hundred. Cancel anytime.

**Q: How do I receive my ticket revenue?**
Revenue is settled to your bank account. Settlement terms depend on your agreement — typically within a few business days after the event.

**Q: Can I use MINGO alongside another ticketing platform?**
Yes. You can run some events on MINGO and others elsewhere. No exclusivity required.

**Q: Do you offer white-label solutions?**

**Q: Who are your existing clients?**
