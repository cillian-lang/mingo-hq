### Joe Post 1 — The Origin Story

When we started MINGO in 2016, people told us blockchain ticketing was a solution looking for a problem.

Then the DOJ launched antitrust cases against legacy ticketing monopolies. Then fake ticket scams crossed $1B globally. Then fans started demanding transparency.

The problem was always there. The industry just didn't want to admit it.

We've been building on Hedera since 2018 — quietly, consistently, through bear markets and bull markets. Because we believed that live events deserved better infrastructure.

Today, MINGO operates across 54 countries. We charge 3.5% where others charge 27%.

The "solution looking for a problem" turned out to be the solution the industry desperately needed.

Still early. Still building.

### Joe Post 2 — Why We Chose Hedera

One of the best decisions we ever made at MINGO was choosing Hedera in 2018.

At the time, everyone was building on Ethereum. The gas fees were unpredictable. The throughput was limited. For ticketing — where you might need to validate 10,000 tickets in an hour at a venue gate — it simply wasn't viable.

Hedera gave us:
→ Sub-second transaction finality
→ Fixed, predictable fees
→ 10,000+ TPS
→ A governing council that includes Google, IBM, and Boeing

When you're building infrastructure for live events, reliability isn't a feature. It's the foundation.

Eight years later, I'm more convinced than ever that we picked the right chain.

### Joe Post 3 — The Fee Problem

I want to put a number in your head: 27%.

That's the average percentage of a ticket's face value that goes to service fees on major ticketing platforms. On a $75 ticket, over $20 goes to the platform — not the artist, not the venue, not the promoter.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office confirmed this in their report on legacy ticketing platform pricing.

At MINGO, we charge 3.5%. Total.

This isn't about undercutting. It's about building technology that doesn't require extracting value from every transaction. Blockchain makes this possible. Hedera makes it practical.

The ticketing industry isn't broken because of technology limitations. It's broken because of business model choices.

We chose differently.

### Joe Post 4 — 54 Countries

A month ago, we announced MINGO's expansion to 54 countries through our partnerships with the African Boxing League, Yucateco Boxing League, and Goldstar Promotions.

I still find that number surreal sometimes.

When you start a company, you dream about moments like this. But the reality of serving events across 4 continents — each with different payment systems, regulatory environments, and cultural expectations — is humbling.

What makes it possible is that our tech is chain-agnostic from the user's perspective. Fans don't need to know what Hedera is. They sign up with email, pay with their card, and get a QR code. The blockchain verification happens invisibly.

That's always been our thesis: web3 benefits with web2 simplicity.

54 countries. Thousands of events. We're just getting started.

### Joe Post 5 — On Building Through Bear Markets

A lesson I've learned building MINGO for nearly a decade:

The companies that survive bear markets are the ones that were building products, not hype.

In 2022, when the crypto market collapsed, we didn't pivot. We didn't rebrand. We kept shipping features, signing partners, and improving our platform.

Because we're not a crypto company that does ticketing. We're a ticketing company that uses blockchain.

That distinction matters. Our users don't care about token prices. They care about getting into their event without being scammed and without paying 27% in fees.

If your product only makes sense during a bull market, you don't have a product. You have a speculation vehicle.

Build things people actually use. The rest follows.

### Joe Post 6 — The Legacy Ticketing Antitrust Moment

The DOJ's antitrust scrutiny of legacy ticketing monopolies has been one of the most significant developments in the live events industry in decades.

For years, monopolistic control over ticketing has meant:
→ Obscene fees for fans
→ Limited choices for organizers
→ Zero transparency in pricing

The scrutiny has validated what we've been saying since 2016: the centralized ticketing model is fundamentally broken.

But here's what most people miss — breaking up a monopoly doesn't solve the underlying technology problem. You still need infrastructure that prevents fraud, enables fair resales, and doesn't require a 27% cut to operate.

That's where blockchain ticketing comes in. That's where MINGO comes in.

Antitrust action opened the door. Now it's up to companies like us to build what comes next.

#Antitrust #EventTech #Ticketing

### Joe Post 7 — Partnership Philosophy

People often ask how we landed partnerships with the World Boxing Council, Fight Circus, and organizations across 54 countries.

The answer is simpler than you'd expect: we solve a real problem at a price that makes sense.

Event organizers don't care about blockchain for blockchain's sake. They care about:
→ Will my tickets be secure?
→ Will my fans have a good experience?
→ How much will it cost me?

When you can answer those three questions better than the alternatives, partnerships follow naturally.

We didn't pitch "NFT ticketing powered by distributed ledger technology." We pitched "3.5% fees, zero fraud, and your fans can buy tickets in 30 seconds."

Technology should be invisible. Value should be obvious.

### Joe Post 8 — What I've Learned as a Founder

10 years of building MINGO. Some things I've learned:

1. The market doesn't care about your roadmap. Ship or be forgotten.
2. Picking the right technology partner early (Hedera, for us) compounds over years.
3. Bear markets are a gift. They clear out the noise.
4. Your first 100 users teach you more than any advisor.
5. The hardest part isn't building the tech. It's convincing an industry to change.

Still learning every day. Still making mistakes.

But I'd rather be building the future of live events than watching someone else do it badly.

### Joe Post 9 — The Combat Sports Bet

When we started focusing on combat sports as our entry vertical, some people questioned it.

"Why not music festivals? Why not conferences?"

Because combat sports is one of the most underserved verticals in live events. The promoters are entrepreneurial, the fans are passionate, and the industry has been ignored by big ticketing platforms.

The WBC, Fight Circus, NUCA MMA, African Boxing League — these organizations were hungry for better technology. They didn't need convincing that 27% fees were a problem. They lived it.

Sometimes the best market entry isn't the biggest market. It's the one that needs you most.

We'll expand into other verticals. But combat sports gave us our foundation, and I'll always be grateful for that.

#Strategy #CombatSports #MarketEntry

### Joe Post 10 — Looking Ahead

54 countries. Thousands of tickets issued. Partnerships with some of the biggest names in combat sports.

But honestly? We're about 5% of the way there.

The global online ticketing market is worth $51 billion. NFT ticketing is projected to reach $7.8 billion by 2033. The opportunity is enormous — and we're still in the first inning.

What's next for MINGO:
→ Deeper integration across the Hedera ecosystem
→ Expansion beyond combat sports into music, entertainment, and conferences
→ Enhanced fan engagement features
→ Growing our team

If you're passionate about live events and blockchain infrastructure, I'd love to connect. We're building something special.

# DEIRDRE ARTHUR — Co-Founder & President

*Tone: Business-minded leader, operational excellence, industry insight. Professional and polished. Focuses on business development, strategic growth, organizational leadership, and the business case for blockchain ticketing. Less technical than Joe, more focused on market opportunity and execution.*

---

### Deirdre Post 1 — The Business Case

When people ask me about MINGO, I don't start with blockchain. I start with numbers.

The global online ticketing market is worth $51 billion. The average platform takes 15-27% in fees. Secondary market fraud costs the industry billions annually.

MINGO charges 3.5% and eliminates fraud entirely through on-chain verification.

The business case writes itself. The technology just makes it possible.

#EventTech #BusinessStrategy #Innovation

### Deirdre Post 2 — Scaling Across Borders

Taking MINGO from a single-market operation to a platform serving 54 countries has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my career.

Every market has nuances — payment preferences, regulatory frameworks, cultural expectations around events.

What I've learned: the key to scaling globally isn't trying to localize everything. It's building core infrastructure that's universally valuable, then adapting the edges.

A 3.5% fee is compelling in Ireland. It's compelling in Lagos. It's compelling in Bangkok. The value proposition translates everywhere.

### Deirdre Post 3 — Women in Web3

Being a woman co-founding a blockchain company in 2016 meant being the only woman in a lot of rooms.

That's changing — slowly. But it's changing.

What I'd say to women considering web3: the technology is genuinely transformative. Don't let the culture put you off. The industry needs diverse perspectives, especially as we build products for mainstream audiences.

Half of live event attendees are women. If the teams building event technology don't reflect that, the products won't serve them well.

Representation isn't just a value. It's a competitive advantage.

#WomenInTech #Web3 #Leadership #Diversity

### Deirdre Post 4 — The Partnership Model

At MINGO, we don't just sell a platform. We build partnerships.

When we work with an organization like the World Boxing Council or the African Boxing League, we're not handing them software and walking away. We're integrating into their operations, understanding their unique challenges, and building solutions around them.

That approach takes longer. It requires more investment. But it creates relationships that last — and partners who become advocates.

In a world of SaaS commoditization, genuine partnership is a differentiator.

#Partnerships #BusinessDevelopment #EventTech

### Deirdre Post 5 — What Organizers Actually Want

After years of conversations with event organizers around the world, I can tell you exactly what they want:

1. Lower fees (more revenue for them and fair prices for fans)
2. No fraud (every ticket is legitimate)
3. Control over resales (set price caps, earn royalties)
4. Easy setup (don't make them learn blockchain)
5. Reliable support (when 5,000 people are at the door, things need to work)

MINGO delivers all five.

It's not about being the most technologically impressive platform. It's about being the most useful one.

### Deirdre Post 6 — On Co-Founding with Family

Co-founding MINGO with Joe has been an incredible journey. Building a company with family brings unique dynamics — the trust is inherent, but so is the intensity.

What makes it work: clear roles. Joe drives the vision and technology. I drive the business operations and strategic growth. We respect each other's lanes.

The best founding teams aren't always the ones with the most impressive CVs. They're the ones with genuine trust and complementary strengths.

Nearly a decade in, and I wouldn't change it.

#Founders #FamilyBusiness #Entrepreneurship

### Deirdre Post 7 — The $51 Billion Opportunity

The global online event ticketing market is valued at $51 billion.

NFT ticketing specifically is projected to reach $7.8 billion by 2033, growing at 24.8% CAGR.

These aren't speculative crypto numbers. This is a fundamental infrastructure shift in how live events operate.

MINGO is positioned at the intersection of both trends — mainstream ticketing market disruption AND the emerging NFT ticketing wave.

The question isn't whether blockchain ticketing will become mainstream. It's which companies will lead that transition.

We intend to be one of them.

#MarketOpportunity #EventTech #Growth

---

### Deirdre Post 8 — Operational Resilience

Running a ticketing platform across 54 countries means things will go wrong. Networks go down. Payment processors have issues. Events get rescheduled.

What separates good companies from great ones is how they handle the unexpected.

At MINGO, we've built operational resilience into everything we do. Our progressive web app works on any device with a browser. Our Hedera integration provides sub-second verification even at peak load.

But the most important resilience is human. A team that communicates well, escalates fast, and puts the event organizer first — that's what actually saves you when things get complicated.

Technology is the foundation. People are the insurance.

#Operations #Leadership #Resilience

---

### Deirdre Post 9 — Beyond Tickets

One of the things I'm most excited about at MINGO is our vision beyond basic ticketing.

A ticket doesn't have to be just an entry pass. With NFT technology, it can be:

→ A digital collectible from a historic fight
→ A carrier for exclusive content from the artist
→ A loyalty mechanism for repeat attendees
→ A gateway to VIP experiences and merchandise
→ A verifiable proof that "I was there"

This transforms the relationship between events and fans from transactional to ongoing.

We're not just replacing paper tickets with digital ones. We're reimagining what a ticket can be.

### Deirdre Post 10 — Gratitude

Building MINGO for nearly a decade has been the most challenging thing I've ever done. And the most rewarding.

To our partners who took a chance on blockchain ticketing before it was trendy — thank you.

To our team who kept building through bear markets when it would've been easier to stop — thank you.

To the fans who've used MINGO Tickets and trusted us with their event experiences — thank you.

We're in 54 countries now. We're just getting started. And we wouldn't be here without every one of you.

Here's to the next decade.

# JASON TEJI — COO

*Tone: Operations-focused, technically informed, Hedera ecosystem ambassador. More hands-on and tactical than Joe. Talks about product details, integrations, and the Hedera community. Active conference presence. Energetic, direct, community-oriented.*

### Jason Post 1 — The Hedera Ecosystem

One of the things I love about the Hedera ecosystem is the quality of builders.

It's not about hype cycles or meme coins. It's enterprise-grade infrastructure with a community that genuinely cares about building useful things.

MINGO has been part of this ecosystem since 2018. The relationships we've built with other Hedera projects, the foundation, and the community have been invaluable.

If you're building on Hedera — reach out. This ecosystem wins together.

### Jason Post 2 — Conference Season

Just back from another conference and I'm reminded why in-person events matter so much.

You can have a hundred video calls, but nothing replaces sitting across from a potential partner and showing them a live demo of MINGO Tickets on their phone.

Their face when they realize there's no app to download. No crypto wallet to set up. Just email, purchase, QR code.

That moment of "wait, it's THAT simple?" is worth every hour of travel.

#Conferences #EventTech #LiveDemo

---

### Jason Post 3 — SaucerSwap Integration

Excited about our SaucerSwap integration in the MINGO Wallet.

Users can now swap between Hedera tokens directly in the app. No need to leave the ecosystem.

This is what composability looks like in practice — ticketing, wallets, and DeFi working together seamlessly.

Building on Hedera means building with the best.

### Jason Post 4 — What COO Actually Means

People ask what a COO does at a blockchain ticketing company.

Short answer: everything between the vision and the reality.

Longer answer:
→ Making sure our tech works at scale (54 countries is a lot of edge cases)
→ Partner onboarding and support
→ Product operations and quality
→ Representing MINGO at events and conferences
→ Bridging the gap between what we promise and what we deliver

It's not glamorous. But it's essential. The best products in the world fail without operational execution.

#COO #Operations #StartupLife

### Jason Post 5 — The Gate Test

I call it "the gate test."

If 5,000 fans are trying to get into a boxing match, and your ticketing system adds even 3 seconds of friction per person, you've just created a 4-hour queue.

This is why sub-second verification on Hedera isn't a nice-to-have. It's the entire point.

Every technology decision we make at MINGO goes through the gate test: does this make the experience faster, smoother, and more reliable for the person standing at the door?

If the answer is no, we don't ship it.

### Jason Post 6 — From Rogue Creative to MINGO

Before MINGO, I ran Rogue Creative. Moving into blockchain ticketing wasn't the obvious path.

But the more I understood the live events industry, the more obvious the problems became. Obscene fees. Rampant fraud. Zero transparency.

The creative side of me saw the potential for reimagining the entire fan experience. The operational side saw inefficiencies begging to be fixed.

MINGO let me combine both — creativity and operations in service of something that genuinely improves how people experience live events.

Best career decision I ever made.

#CareerJourney #EventTech #Entrepreneurship

---

### Jason Post 7 — Progressive Web Apps

"But there's no app in the App Store..."

Good. That's the point.

MINGO is a progressive web app. It works in your browser. Any device. No download.

Why? Because the #1 barrier to adoption in web3 is friction. Every download, every account creation, every wallet setup is a point where you lose users.

With MINGO: open a link → sign up with email → buy tickets → get QR code.

That's it. That's the whole flow.

The best technology is the kind you don't notice.

#PWA #UserExperience #Web3

---

### Jason Post 8 — The Hedera Advantage for Ticketing

I get asked "why Hedera?" at every conference. Here's the quick version:

Fixed fees → We can price tickets precisely. No gas surprises.
Sub-second finality → Tickets verify instantly at the gate.
10,000+ TPS → We can handle any venue size.
Carbon negative → Events can be genuinely sustainable.
HTS (Hedera Token Service) → Native NFT minting, no smart contract complexity.

For ticketing specifically, no other chain offers this combination.

We've been proving this since 2018.

#Hedera #HBAR #Blockchain #Ticketing

---

### Jason Post 9 — Community First

Something I've noticed in the Hedera ecosystem: the community genuinely roots for each other.

When MINGO announced the 54-country deal, the support from the Hedera community was incredible. Other builders sharing our news, community members celebrating the milestone.

That's rare in crypto. And it's one of the reasons I believe Hedera will win long-term.

Technology matters. Community matters more.

#HederaCommunity #HBAR #Web3

### Jason Post 10 — What's Next

2026 is shaping up to be MINGO's biggest year.

54-country expansion ✅
Hedera case study feature ✅
Growing partnership pipeline ✅

What's coming:
→ More event verticals beyond combat sports
→ Enhanced fan engagement features
→ Deeper Hedera ecosystem integrations
→ Team growth

If you're in the event industry and curious about what blockchain ticketing can do — my DMs are open.

Let's build.

# CILLIAN ARTHUR — Marketing Manager

*Tone: Young, energetic, marketing-savvy. Speaks about brand building, content strategy, social media, and the creative side of MINGO. More casual than the C-suite but still professional.

### Cillian Post 1 — Why I'm Still Here

I've been with MINGO for years now. And every year, people ask: "Why stick with a blockchain startup?"

Because every year, the product gets better and the industry problem gets worse. 54 countries. 3.5% fees vs the legacy 27%. Combat sports partnerships that are actually delivering.

When your product sells itself, marketing becomes the fun part — making sure the world knows it exists.

We're just getting started. 🎟️⚡

### Cillian Post 2 — The Marketing Challenge

Here's the interesting thing about marketing blockchain ticketing:

You have to sell the benefit without scaring people with the technology.

Nobody cares that their ticket is an NFT on Hedera. They care that it can't be faked, it's cheaper, and it works on their phone.

The best web3 marketing doesn't mention web3 at all. It just shows people a better experience.

#MarketingStrategy #Web3 #Branding

### Cillian Post 3 — Content That Converts

Marketing tip for anyone in the web3 space:

Stop talking about your technology. Start talking about your user's problem.

❌ "Our NFT tickets use Hedera Token Service for on-chain verification"
✅ "No more fake tickets. Every ticket verified instantly at the door."

Same product. Completely different resonance.

The best marketing is translation — taking what engineers build and making it matter to normal people.

#ContentStrategy #Marketing #Web3Marketing

### Cillian Post 4 — Combat Sports Marketing

Marketing combat sports events is a different beast.

The fans are passionate. The content is visceral. The energy is unmatched.

Working with partners like the World Boxing Council, Fight Circus, and NUCA MMA means I get to create content for some of the most engaged audiences in sports.

Blockchain ticketing + combat sports is a combination nobody saw coming. And it works brilliantly.

#CombatSports #Marketing #Boxing #MMA

### Cillian Post 5 — Social Media Reality

Building a brand on social media in 2026:

→ Organic reach is dying (unless you're genuinely interesting)
→ Engagement beats follower count every time
→ Consistency > virality
→ Community engagement is more valuable than broadcast
→ Every platform has different rules — respect them

At MINGO, we're rebuilding our social strategy from the ground up. Real engagement with the Hedera ecosystem. Content that educates, not just announces.

It's a marathon, not a sprint.

#SocialMedia #Marketing #BrandBuilding

---

### Cillian Post 6 — The Hedera Community

One thing that still impresses me about working in this space: the Hedera community is different.

Less noise. More substance. People actually building things and supporting each other.

When we post content that engages with the Hedera ecosystem, the amplification is massive — 30x compared to our standard content.

That tells me two things:
1. The community is active and engaged
2. There's genuine interest in real-world use cases on Hedera

We're going to lean into this. Hard.

### Cillian Post 7 — Behind the Scenes

People see the polished social posts and partnership announcements.

They don't see:
→ The 3am content planning sessions
→ The 47 versions of a graphic before one gets approved
→ The spreadsheets tracking every engagement metric
→ The competitor analysis docs that run 20 pages deep

Marketing isn't just creativity. It's strategy, data, and relentless iteration.

Enjoying every minute of it at MINGO.

### Cillian Post 8 — Why Ticketing Matters

I never thought I'd be this passionate about ticketing.

But when you realize the industry takes 27% from artists and fans while offering zero transparency and enabling fraud at scale...

And then you see a platform that charges 3.5%, verifies every ticket on-chain, and works in 54 countries...

Yeah. This matters. This is worth fighting for.

#EventTech #Ticketing #Purpose

---

### Cillian Post 9 — Marketing in Web3 vs Web2

The biggest difference between web3 and web2 marketing:

In web2, you're selling to consumers.
In web3, you're selling to a community.

Communities are harder. They're skeptical. They've seen a hundred projects promise the moon.

The only way to earn their trust: ship product, show traction, be transparent.

That's our approach at MINGO. Less hype, more proof.

#Web3Marketing #Community #Trust

---

### Cillian Post 10 — The Vision

Here's what gets me up in the morning:

Imagine going to a concert. Your ticket cost a fair price. You know it's genuine. At the door, it verifies in under a second. After the event, you have a digital collectible proving you were there. The artist earned from your ticket AND from any resale.

That's not a vision. That's MINGO today.

Now imagine that across every event, in every country, for every fan.

That's what we're building.
